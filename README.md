# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard using JavaScript and Plotly to visualize bacterial biodiversity from human belly button samples. Analyzed sample data to explore bacterial distribution across over 150 participants.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Plotly.js
- HTML/CSS
- JSON data handling
- Data Visualization

## File Structure

## Skills Demonstrated

- Building interactive dashboards with JavaScript
- Visualizing hierarchical biological data
- Cleaning and transforming JSON data for analysis
- Using Plotly for dynamic charts and visual storytelling

## Key Findings

- Analyzed belly button bacterial data from 153 participants.
- Identified OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) 1167 as the most common bacteria across participants.
- Created interactive visualizations to display sample diversity and washing frequency per participant.
